This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, create a `.env` file and fill your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`:

__.env__
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=***********
```

Then:
```bash
# install deps
npm install

# run the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Play with the code
- Agent code is within `lib/app.ts`
